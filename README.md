# Auto_Insurance_Final_Project
Machine Learning model for Auto Insurance Industry made as a final project in AI | ML course

<b>Aim of the Project:</b>

The aim of the project is to build a Machine Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

<b>Use Cases:</b>

The model shall mainly support the following use cases:

1. Conquering Market Share: Capture market share by lowering the prices of the premium for the customers, who are least likely to claim.
2. Risk Management: Charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim insurance in the coming year
3. Smooth Processing: Reduce the complexity of pricing models. Most of the transactions are happening online with larger customer attributes (thanks to the internet and social media). Harness the power of huge data to build complex ML models
4. Increased Profits: As per industry estimate 1% reduction in the claim can boost profit by 10%. So, through the ML model, we can identify and deny the insurance to the driver who will make a claim. Thus, ensuring reduced claim outgo and increased profit.
Part of the model development is to identify and prioritize the above use cases.

<b>Various Tasks Performed on data are as below:</b>

<b>Exploratory Data Analysis:</b>

1. Write at least 3 important inferences from the data above
2. Is the data balanced? Meaning are targets 0 and 1 in the right proportion?
3. How many categorical features are there?
4. How many binary features are there?
5. Write inferences from data on interval variables.
6. Write inferences from data on ordinal variables.
7. Write inferences from data on binary variables.
8. Check if the target data is proportionate or not. Hint: Below than 30% for binary data is sign of imbalance
9. What should be the preferred way in this case to balance the data?
10. How many training records are there after achieving a balance of 12%?
11. Which are the top two features in terms of missing values?
12. In total, how many features have missing values?
13. What steps should be taken to handle the missing data?
14. Which interval variables have strong correlation?
15. What's the level of correlation among ordinal features?
16. Implement Hot Encoding for categorical features
17. In nominal and interval features, which features are suitable for StandardScaler?
18. Summarize the learnings of ED

<b>Modeling :</b>

1. The Simple Logistic Regression Model seems to have high accuracy. Is that what we need at all? What is the problem with this model?
2. Why do you think f1-score is 0.0?
3. What is the precision and recall score for the model?
4. What is the most important inference you can draw from the result?
5. What is the accuracy score and f1-score for the improved Logistic Regression model?
6. Why do you think f1-score has improved?
7. For model LinearSVC play with parameters – dual, max_iter and see if there is any improvement
8. SVC with Imbalance Check & Feature Optimization & only 100K Records → is there improvement in scores?
9. XGBoost is one the better classifiers -- but still f1-score is very low. What could be the reason?
10. What is the increase in number of features after one-hot encoding of the data?
11. Is there any improvement in scores after encoding?
12. If not missing a positive sample is the priority which model is best so far?
13. If not marking negative sample as positive is top priority, which model is best so far?
14. Do you think using AdaBoost can give any significant improvement over XGBoost?
15. MLPClassifier is the neural network we are trying. But how to choose the right no. of layers and size?
16. At what layer size we get the best f1-score?
